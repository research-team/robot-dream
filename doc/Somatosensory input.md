Bothelectrophysiological and anatomical characteristicsof these two pathways lead us to suggest they arestrongly implicated in the affective emotional andautonomic aspects of pain. <h2>Other ascending pathways</h2>The spinoreticular tract, which is responsible for increasing our level of arousal/alertness in response to the pain or temperature. The fibres ascend from the muscles, joints and skin to synapse in the reticular formation.The spinotectal tract, which enables us to orient our eyes and move our head toward the relevant stimulus. The fibres ascend to synapse in the superior colliculi of the midbrain.
