<h2> Spinothalamic tract</h2>  
 The pathways for detection of pain, temperature and very light (poorly localized) touch are distinct from those conveying well-localized touch, pressure, vibration and conscious proprioception.
 Beyond the peripheral
nociceptor and dorsal horn, nociceptive information
ascends to the thalamus in the contralateral spinothalamic
tract (STT)

Cortical areas that receive information from the
spinothalamic tract. Main spinothalamic and thalamocortical
projections were summarized and simplified from several
reports on the central nociceptive pathways in the monkey
 Cortico-cortical connections are not shown. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex;
CL, centrolateral nucleus; MDvc, ventrocaudal part of medial
dorsal nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; SI, primary
somatosensory cortex; SII, secondary somatosensory cortex;
VMpo, posterior part of ventromedial nucleus; VPI, ventral
posterior inferior nucleus; VPL, ventral posterior lateral
nucleus; VPM, ventral posterior medial nucleus. (Note that the
insula is now considered to lie between the lateral and medial
systems, since it has both a sensory-discriminative and a
cognitive-evaluative role in pain sensation).

Recent studies provide evidence of new pain
pathways such as the spino hypothalamic tract  and the spino-parabrachio
-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathways,
the latter two being the subject of this report. Both
electrophysiological and anatomical characteristics
of these two pathways lead us to suggest they are
strongly implicated in the affective emotional and
autonomic aspects of pain.
