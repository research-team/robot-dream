Main spinothalamic and thalamocorticalprojections were summarized and simplified from severalreports on the central nociceptive pathways in the monkey Cortico-cortical connections are not shown. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex;CL, centrolateral nucleus; MDvc, ventrocaudal part of medialdorsal nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; SI, primarysomatosensory cortex; SII, secondary somatosensory cortex;VMpo, posterior part of ventromedial nucleus; VPI, ventralposterior inferior nucleus; VPL, ventral posterior lateralnucleus; VPM, ventral posterior medial nucleus. (Note that theinsula is now considered to lie between the lateral and medialsystems, since it has both a sensory-discriminative and acognitive-evaluative role in pain sensation). Cortical area | Possible functions | ------------ | ------------- SI|  Sensory discriminative in general,alternatively: stimulus localizationSII and 7b | Sensory integrative (touch, pain, visual),spatially directed attentionInsula|Sensory integrative (touch, pain, taste,vestibular), visceral sensory, visceralmotor, limbic integrationAnterior cingulate| Response selection, motor suppression,attention, affectPrefrontal cortex|  Affect, emotion, memory[link4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308618683)[link 5](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308618683/pdf?md5=24100436b36c46c85645bd5654b84e2d&pid=1-s2.0-S0079612308618683-main.pdf)<h2> Spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathway</h2>Recent studies provide evidence of new painpathways such as the spino hypothalamic tract  and the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathways,the latter two being the subject of this report. Bothelectrophysiological and anatomical characteristicsof these two pathways lead us to suggest they arestrongly implicated in the affective emotional andautonomic aspects of pain. ![ Spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathway](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/research-team/robot-dream/0d23e91095b737a0c3d5f62721ea6cead952f45b/doc/%20Spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid%20and%20-hypothalamic%20pathway.png)<h2>Other ascending pathways</h2>The spinoreticular tract, which is responsible for increasing our level of arousal/alertness in response to the pain or temperature. The fibres ascend from the muscles, joints and skin to synapse in the reticular formation.The spinotectal tract, which enables us to orient our eyes and move our head toward the relevant stimulus. The fibres ascend to synapse in the superior colliculi of the midbrain.
