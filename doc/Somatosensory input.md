Parabrachial checks if the pain is being received in normal temperatures and if the gustatory system is active; if both are so the pain is assumed to be due to poison. The amygdala and hippocampus |  create and encode the memory and emotion due to pain stimuli.The hypothalamus | signals for the release of hormones that make pain suppression more effective, some of these include sex hormonesPeriaqueductal grey | signals reticular formationâ€™s raphe nuclei to produce serotonin that inhibits laminae pain nucleiThe somatosensory cortex |   decodes nociceptor info to determine the exact location of pain and is where proprioception is brought into consciousness; inferior cerebellar peduncle is all unconscious proprioception<h2> Spinothalamic tract</h2>   The pathways for detection of pain, temperature and very light (poorly localized) touch are distinct from those conveying well-localized touch, pressure, vibration and conscious proprioception. Beyond the peripheralnociceptor and dorsal horn, nociceptive informationascends to the thalamus in the contralateral spinothalamictract (STT)![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/research-team/robot-dream/master/doc/STT.PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/research-team/robot-dream/master/doc/STT.PNG)Cortical areas that receive information from thespinothalamic tract. Main spinothalamic and thalamocorticalprojections were summarized and simplified from severalreports on the central nociceptive pathways in the monkey Cortico-cortical connections are not shown. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex;CL, centrolateral nucleus; MDvc, ventrocaudal part of medialdorsal nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; SI, primarysomatosensory cortex; SII, secondary somatosensory cortex;VMpo, posterior part of ventromedial nucleus; VPI, ventralposterior inferior nucleus; VPL, ventral posterior lateralnucleus; VPM, ventral posterior medial nucleus. (Note that theinsula is now considered to lie between the lateral and medialsystems, since it has both a sensory-discriminative and acognitive-evaluative role in pain sensation). ![ Spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathway](https://github.com/research-team/robot-dream/blob/48cebb3239d2c2c04d7d632347441aa57bccf464/doc/Final%20pathway.png)[link5](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308618683)[link 6](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612308618683/pdf?md5=24100436b36c46c85645bd5654b84e2d&pid=1-s2.0-S0079612308618683-main.pdf)<h2> Spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathway</h2>Recent studies provide evidence of new painpathways such as the spino hypothalamic tract  and the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid and -hypothalamic pathways,the latter two being the subject of this report. Bothelectrophysiological and anatomical characteristicsof these two pathways lead us to suggest they arestrongly implicated in the affective emotional andautonomic aspects of pain. <h2>Other ascending pathways</h2>The spinoreticular tract, which is responsible for increasing our level of arousal/alertness in response to the pain or temperature. The fibres ascend from the muscles, joints and skin to synapse in the reticular formation.The spinotectal tract, which enables us to orient our eyes and move our head toward the relevant stimulus. The fibres ascend to synapse in the superior colliculi of the midbrain.
