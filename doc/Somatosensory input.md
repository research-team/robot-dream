Line thickness illustrates the percentage of connections in the corresponding pathway. (b) Incoming E/I connections for excitatory (left, nE = 26,567) and inhibitory (right, nI = 4,779) cells. Data depict a single exemplar NMC instance (darker colors indicate deeper layers, as in Figure 1; black diagonal lines indicate the identity line; white crosses indicate the mean). (c) E/I connections ratio distribution among excitatory (red) and inhibitory (cyan) population (lines indicate the average over all seven instances and shading indicates the s.d.; the mean E/I ratio per curve is indicated by triangle markers). (d–i) As in a–c but in terms of (d–f) total number of synaptic contacts (synapses: 36,471,080 ± 554,503) and (g–i) total peak synaptic conductance (30.74 ± 0.47 mS). Note the excess excitation vs. inhibition in all three cases. The shifting of the bottom histograms toward 1 implies a higher conductance-based E/I balance. P values of Pearson correlations coefficients are < 0.001 for all six scatterplots.</h4>
