The lemniscal pathway relays whisker signals through the principal trigeminal nucleus (PrV) and projects from there to the dorsal medial region of VPM nucleus (VPMdm) of the thalamus. Here, the axons from a specific “barrelette” in the trigeminal nucleus contact neurons in the corresponding contralateral thalamic “barreloid,” a cytoarchitectonic structure which is a curved, tapering rod with an oblique orientation. The lemniscal pathway can be subdivided into two separate branches depending on the target region in the VPM barreloid (Figure1)). The so-called “lemniscal ” branch innervates the core region of the VPM barreloid while the “lemniscal ” branch project to its head region. Axons arising from VPM neurons in the barreloid core innervate predominantly layer 4 and 6A of the corresponding S1 barrel column and to a lesser extent also layer 3 and 5B and have single-whisker receptive fields . A small fraction of VPM neurons may have larger receptive fields but their exact location in the barreloid was not determined . In marked contrast, afferents arising from the head of the VPM barreloid [i.e., those in the lemniscal branch] innervate exclusively neurons located in the L4 “septa” and have multi-whisker receptive fields

The majority of the lemniscal thalamic afferents, in particular those arising from the core VPM barreloids, show a clear barrel-column related axonal projection with profuse branching at the level of a single barrel in layer 4 . However, some VPM neurons possess axons that bifurcate in layer 6 or 5 to innervate two or more barrel columns; these may arise from other regions, e.g., the barreloid head . This structural feature may contribute to the relatively large subthreshold whisker-related receptive fields (as defined by EPSP recordings) in layer 4 that have been observed in in vivo studies . Nevertheless, even these bifurcating thalamocortical axons showed a clear preference for a barrel-related columns (Arnold et al., 2001).

Note the excess excitation vs. inhibition in all three cases. The shifting of the bottom histograms toward 1 implies a higher conductance-based E/I balance. P values of Pearson correlations coefficients are < 0.001 for all six scatterplots . </h4>

<h2> Spinothalamic tract</h2>  
 Beyond the peripheral

ascends to the thalamus in the contralateral spinothalamic

Cortical areas that receive information from the
spinothalamic tract. Main spinothalamic and thalamocortical
projections were summarized and simplified from several
reports on the central nociceptive pathways in the monkey
 Cortico-cortical connections are not shown. ACC, anterior cingulate cortex;
CL, centrolateral nucleus; MDvc, ventrocaudal part of medial
dorsal nucleus; Pf, parafascicular nucleus; SI, primary
somatosensory cortex; SII, secondary somatosensory cortex;
VMpo, posterior part of ventromedial nucleus; VPI, ventral
posterior inferior nucleus; VPL, ventral posterior lateral
nucleus; VPM, ventral posterior medial nucleus. (Note that the
insula is now considered to lie between the lateral and medial
systems, since it has both a sensory-discriminative and a
cognitive-evaluative role in pain sensation).
