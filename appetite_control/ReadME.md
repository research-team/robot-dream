### VTA, LH
Projections from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), containing both GABAergic and glutamatergic components, encode conditioned responses and control compulsive reward-seeking behavior. GABAergic neurons in the LH have been shown to mediate appetitive and feeding-related behaviors. Here, we show that the GABAergic component of the LH-VTA pathway supports positive reinforcement and place preference, while the glutamatergic component mediates place avoidance. In addition, our results indicate that photoactivation of these projections modulates other behaviors, such as social interaction and perseverant investigation of a novel object. We provide evidence that photostimulation of the GABAergic LH-VTA component, but not the glutamatergic component, increases dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) via inhibition of local VTA GABAergic neurons. Our study clarifies how GABAergic LH inputs to the VTA can contribute to generalized behavioral activation across multiple contexts, consistent with a role in increasing motivational salience.

### DMV, NTS
The activity of DMV neurons, and hence vagal efferent activity, is also regulated by synaptic inputs from several brainstem and higher CNS nuclei. As mentioned previously, gastric functions have been studied most commonly in anesthetized animals; under these “basal” conditions, the activity of DMV neurons innervating the GI tract is regulated by an ongoing, tonic inhibitory GABAergic input (22, 175, 447, 496). The majority of these inhibitory inputs arise from the adjacent nucleus tractus solitarius [NTS; (499)] although DMV neurons also receive innervation from several other brainstem and higher CNS nuclei (see below). While DMV neurons also receive excitatory glutamatergic and catecholaminergic inputs from the NTS, they do not appear to be as critical in regulating the tonic activity of vagal efferent motoneurons (412, 447). It is also important to note, at this point, that several morphological studies have shown that the dendritic projections of DMV neurons can extend into the NTS, the area postrema and even penetrate the ependymal layer of the fourth ventricle (407, 437) suggesting that vagal motoneurons are capable of responding to circulating factors directly. Additionally, the brainstem area containing the dorsal vagal complex (DVC, i.e., DMV, NTS, and area postrema) is essentially a circumventricular organ, lying ventral to the fourth ventricle and is highly vascularized with fenestrated capillaries (111, 171). An additional layer of neurons, termed subependymal cerebrospinal containing neurons (CSF-cNs) are positioned, strategically, between the CSF and neuronal parenchyma and potentially integrate CSF signaling with autonomic homeostatic signaling (361). Indeed, we have demonstrated previously that brainstem neurons can be excited following peripheral administration of the GI neurohormone, cholecystokinin (CCK) even after surgical removal of vagal afferent input to the brainstem (31) implying that the activity of central vagal neurons, including DMV neurons, may be modulated directly by circulating factors.
The DVC is innervated by several brainstem and higher CNS centers involved in autonomic regulation. NTS neurons, which provide the most prominent source of synaptic inputs to GI-projecting DMV neurons, play a critical role in shaping the activity of the efferent vagus nerve (Fig. 1). In addition to their involvement in vagal autonomic neurocircuits via their projections to vagal efferent motoneurons, NTS neurons are also the recipient of inputs from vagal afferent (sensory) fibers that innervate the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Indeed, while the vagus is a mixed sensory/motor nerve, it is predominantly sensory with 70% to 80% of vagal fibers being of sensory origin depending on the species (reviewed in (52)). Vagal afferents that transduce and relay information from the GI tract can be classified based upon their response to distention or pressure (principally low-threshold, although nociceptive high-threshold fibers also exist), the location of their receptive fields (mucosal, muscle, or serosal/mesenteric), their preferred stimulus modality (chemical, osmotic, mechanical, both in-series and in-parallel) or the region of GI tract innervated [reviewed in (52)]. Regardless of their sensory modality or function, the cell bodies of these vagal afferent fibers lie within the nodose ganglia (or nodose-petrosal-jugular ganglion complex) and their central terminals enter the brainstem via the tractus solitarius, and impinge, principally, onto NTS neurons. Within the NTS, neurons are organized in subnuclei which display a viscerotopic manner relative to their afferent inputs (10, 12, 36). Gastric vagal afferents, for example, innervate neurons within the NTS gelatinosus and commisuralis while esophageal afferents innervate neurons within the NTS centralis (10, 69). While cardiovascular and respiratory afferents innervate neurons within the medial and ventrolateral NTS (333, 400), it is important to recognize that the dendritic projections of NTS extent throughout the nucleus and intermingle within the various subnuclei [reviewed in (253)] providing a potential means by which homeostatic reflexes may be co-ordinated across autonomic organs.

### AP, PBN, NTS
The parabrachial nucleus (PBN), within the brachium of the pons, is composed of several subnuclei; the medial PBN is part of the gustatory system while the lateral PBN is part of the visceral sensory system. The medial PBN receives gustatory information from the NTS whereas the lateral PBN, in contrast, receives GI viscerosensory information from both the NTS and the AP (218) (Fig. 1). The PBN, together with the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, positioned within the ventrolateral extent of the nucleus, forms the parabrachial complex (PB complex). The PB complex integrates the gustatory and GI sensory information received from the NTS together with general visceral information (cardiovascular, respiratory, and nociceptive) received from the NTS and AP plus GI and seomatosensory information from the cerebellum (408). Indeed, studies have demonstrated that PB complex neurons may receive converging inputs from vestibular and visceral vagal afferents (453) and from orosensory and visceral vagal afferents (259) suggesting some potential for integration of afferent information.
PB complex neurons relay this sensory information to a number of structures including the thalamus, insular cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and lateral hypothalamus (172) (Figs. 1 and and2).2). Neurons of the PB complex also receive reciprocal connections from several of these higher ascending structures, including the cortex, basal forebrain and hypothalamus (337). Descending projection from the PB complex innervate the RVLM as well as the NTS (218) while descending projections from the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus innervate the sympathetic preganglionic column of the spinal cord, the nucleus ambiguus, the NTS and the rostro- and ventrolateral medulla (448). The PB complex, therefore, occupies an important position as an integrative relay between brainstem and forebrain integrative autonomic regulation and provides a neuroanatomical substrate for the involvement and integration of affective and emotional responses to visceral, including GI and gustatory, sensory information.

### LH
The hypothalamus, a small area of the brain located just below the thalamus, is the regulating center of appetite and energy homeostasis. The hypothalamus consists of several interconnecting nuclei: the arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), ventromedial nucleus (VMN), and the dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) (Fig. 1). The ARC of the hypothalamus is adjacent to the median eminence, a circumventricular organ having defective blood-brain barriers (BBB). Thus, circulating hormones and nutrients can access the ARC without passing the BBB. Moreover, the ARC surrounds the third cerebroventricle. Hormones and nutrients in the cerebrospinal fluid can diffuse into the extracellular fluids of the ARC. Due to these anatomical features, the ARC is considered to be a hypothalamic area primarily sensing peripheral metabolic signals. In the ARC, there are two distinct neuronal populations: one is a group of neurons coexpressing orexigenic neuropeptides, including neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and the other is a subset of neurons expressing anorexigenic neuropeptides, including proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). These neurons are first-order neurons where peripheral metabolic signals including leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and nutrients are primarily transferred. Anorexigenic monoamine serotonin also acts on POMC neurons through the 5HT-2C receptor to induce anorexia [3]. POMC neurons send axonal projections to the second-order neurons in other hypothalamic areas, the PVN, VMN, and LHA.
The α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide, is produced by the posttranscriptional processing of POMC and released from presynaptic terminals of POMC neurons. By binding to the melanocortin-3 and -4 receptor (MC3R, MC4R) on the second order neurons, α-MSH activates catabolic pathways: reduced food intake and enhanced energy expenditure [4]. Targeted deletion of the MC4R in mice resulted in hyperphagia, reduced energy expenditure, and obesity [4]. In humans, MC4R mutations account for about 6% of severe early-onset obesity [5], supporting an important role for the central melanocortin system in the control of energy metabolism.
Endogenous melanocotin receptor antagonist AgRP is released from the terminals of ARC NPY/AgRP-producing neurons to the synaptic space on the second order neurons where it competes with α-MSH on MC3R and MC4R and antagonizes the effects of α-MSH [6]. Selective ablation of NPY/AgRP neurons in young mice resulted in a significant decrease in food intake and body weight [7], suggesting that these neurons are critical for promoting food intake and preventing weight loss.
The PVN neurons synthesize and secrete neuropeptides that have a net catabolic action, including the corticotrophin-releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin, vasopressin, and oxytocin. In addition, PVN sends sympathetic outflow to the peripheral metabolic organs, including liver and adipose tissue, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis [8]. Destruction of PVN and haploinsufficiency of Sim1, a critical transcriptional factor in the development of PVN, caused hyperphagia and obesity [9], implying a inhibitory role for PVN in food intake and weight gain.
The VMN mainly receives neuronal projections from the ARC, and projects their axons to the ARC, DMN and LHA, as well as brainstem regions. The VMN contains neurons that sense glucose and leptin [10]. Moreover, anorexigenic neuropeptide, a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is produced in the VMN [11]. Destruction of the VMN caused hyperphagia and obesity, as well as hyperglycemia [12]. Thus, the VMN is regarded as a pivotal area in generating satiety and maintaining glucose homeostasis. The DMN contains a high level of NPY terminals and α-MSH terminals originating from the ARC [13]. Destruction of DMN also results in hyperphagia and obesity [14].
In contrast to PVN, VMN, and DMN, destruction of LHA leads to hypophagia and weight loss. Therefore, LHA has been considered to be a feeding center. LHA contains two neuronal populations producing orexigenic neuropeptides, the melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin, also called hypocretin. NPY/AgRP- and α-MSH-immunoreactive terminals from ARC neurons are in contact with MCH- and orexin-expressing neurons. Orexin-producing neurons are also involved in glucose sensing and the regulation of sleep-awake cycles [15]. Mice with orexin receptor 2 displayed canine narcolepsy. On the other hand, depletion of MCH or the MCH 1 receptor in mice attenuated body weight, suggesting that MCH acts as endogenous orexigenic molecules [16].
